title: Signal Generator
---

Scoppy includes a very basic (PWM) signal generator. This is accessed by tapping the SIGNAL GENERATOR
button on the menu panel.   

You can choose from a 50% duty cycle square wave at various frequencies and a PWM encoded sine wave.
Using a low pass filter the PWM encoded sine wave can
be used to generate an analog signal.
